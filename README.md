**Melody Social** - A Social Music Player

### Idea
These days the music players don’t have all the features we desire and the exposure to music is bottlenecked by the music retailers. In response to this we decided to make our own music player. The concept we have is to create a player that is intuitive and can provide users more control of their player. 

Planned features include:

- UI Customization
- Gesture Controls
- Up Next - a dynamic playlist

We also wanted to add a social side to this so we decided to apply a way to *collect* music from the people around you. The idea is inspired by the *Nintendo StreetPass* where people can exchange their profiles by passing another StreetPass user. We wish to bring this into a music player to create a social music player, **Meso**. People are able to share the music that they have been listening to just by passing someone on the streets.

### Initial Research
##### Competition
There are a few alternative music player on the AppStore, some of which have similar features to our planned app. However, none of them had its own social feature (For example, the app **Lagu** only provides integration with Facebook/Twitter)

**Pandora** and **Spotify** are two other social music platforms.

##### Technology & Frameworks
Integration with built-in music player requires

- Media Player Framework

To provide connectivity with other devices running the application, the following frameworks are required

- Core Bluetooth (over low-energy Bluetooth)
- Bonjour API (over WiFi)
